# tbd-dnd

Drag and Drop is undoubtedly one of the most popular and user-friendly interactions in software nowadays. There are plenty awesome libraries for DnD in React realm, covering most of the use cases. We tried them all at @productboard, but realized we need something special for complex interfaces we are building. We developed our own solution that satisfied three main requirements we had:

1. Delightful user experience 🤩
2. Great performance even for large datasets 🏎
3. Reusability of already existing code 🔌
